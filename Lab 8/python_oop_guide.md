## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). The main principles of OOP are:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit (class)
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms

## Classes and Objects

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own set of attribute values.

```python
# Defining a simple class
class Dog:
    # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Creating objects (instances of the Dog class)
fido = Dog()
buddy = Dog()

# Accessing class attributes
print(fido.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris
print(buddy.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris

# Calling instance methods
print(fido.bark())  # Output: Woof!
```

## Attributes and Methods

**Attributes** are variables that belong to a class or an object. There are two types:
- **Class attributes**: Shared by all instances of a class
- **Instance attributes**: Unique to each instance

**Methods** are functions defined within a class. There are several types:
- **Instance methods**: Operate on an instance of the class (have `self` as first parameter)
- **Class methods**: Operate on the class itself (have `cls` as first parameter)
- **Static methods**: Don't operate on instance or class (no special first parameter)

```python
class Student:
    # Class attribute
    school = "Python High"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."
    
    # Class method
    @classmethod
    def change_school(cls, new_school):
        cls.school = new_school
    
    # Static method
    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age >= 18

# Creating instances
alice = Student("Alice", 16)
bob = Student("Bob", 19)

# Using instance method
print(alice.introduce())  # Output: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 16 years old.

# Using class method
Student.change_school("Python University")
print(alice.school)  # Output: Python University
print(bob.school)    # Output: Python University

# Using static method
print(Student.is_adult(alice.age))  # Output: False
print(Student.is_adult(bob.age))    # Output: True
```

## Constructors and Initialization

The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when a new object is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes.

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

# Creating a rectangle with width=5 and height=3
rect = Rectangle(5, 3)

print(rect.width)      # Output: 5
print(rect.height)     # Output: 3
print(rect.area())     # Output: 15
print(rect.perimeter())  # Output: 16
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It also includes the concept of restricting access to some of the object's components.

In Python, encapsulation is implemented using:
- **Private attributes/methods**: Prefixed with double underscore `__`
- **Protected attributes/methods**: Prefixed with single underscore `_`

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            return True
        return False
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return True
        return False
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Creating a bank account
account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)

# Accessing public attribute
print(account.owner)  # Output: Alice

# Trying to access private attribute (will not work as expected)
# print(account.__balance)  # AttributeError

# Using methods to interact with private attribute
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
account.withdraw(200)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called a **subclass** or **derived class**, and the class being inherited from is called a **superclass** or **base class**.

```python
# Base class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

# Derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Another derived class
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Creating instances
generic_animal = Animal("Generic")
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(generic_animal.name)  # Output: Generic
print(dog.name)            # Output: Buddy
print(cat.name)            # Output: Whiskers

print(generic_animal.speak())  # Output: Some sound
print(dog.speak())            # Output: Woof!
print(cat.speak())            # Output: Meow!
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It's often achieved through method overriding.

```python
# Using the Animal, Dog, and Cat classes from the previous example

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

# Creating instances
generic_animal = Animal("Generic")
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Polymorphic behavior
print(animal_sound(generic_animal))  # Output: Some sound
print(animal_sound(dog))            # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))            # Output: Meow!

# Another example of polymorphism with built-in functions
animals = [generic_animal, dog, cat]
for animal in animals:
    print(f"{animal.name} says {animal.speak()}")
```

## Method Overriding

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def area(self):
        return 0
    
    def describe(self):
        return f"I am a {self.name} with area {self.area()}"

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        super().__init__("Circle")
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__("Rectangle")
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Creating instances
circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)

print(circle.describe())    # Output: I am a Circle with area 78.5
print(rectangle.describe())  # Output: I am a Rectangle with area 24
```

## Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed. It often contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.

In Python, abstract classes are created using the `abc` module.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    def describe(self):
        return f"I am a {self.name} with area {self.area()}"

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        super().__init__("Circle")
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__("Rectangle")
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# This would raise an error:
# shape = Shape("Generic")  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class

# Creating instances of concrete subclasses
circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)

print(circle.describe())    # Output: I am a Circle with area 78.5
print(rectangle.describe())  # Output: I am a Rectangle with area 24
```

## Special Methods (Magic Methods)

Python classes can implement special methods (also called magic methods or dunder methods) that enable instances to work with built-in functions and operators.

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    # String representation
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    # Formal representation
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    # Addition
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    # Subtraction
    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
    
    # Equality
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y
    
    # Length (magnitude)
    def __abs__(self):
        return (self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5

# Creating vectors
v1 = Vector(3, 4)
v2 = Vector(1, 2)

print(v1)          # Output: Vector(3, 4)
print(v1 + v2)     # Output: Vector(4, 6)
print(v1 - v2)     # Output: Vector(2, 2)
print(v1 == v2)    # Output: False
print(abs(v1))     # Output: 5.0 (magnitude of vector)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Class names should use CamelCase
   - Method and attribute names should use snake_case
   - Constants should be in ALL_CAPS

2. **Use docstrings** to document your classes and methods:
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       """
       This class does something useful.
       
       Attributes:
           attr1: Description of attribute 1
           attr2: Description of attribute 2
       """
       
       def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
           """
           Does something with the arguments.
           
           Args:
               arg1: Description of arg1
               arg2: Description of arg2
               
           Returns:
               Description of return value
           """
           # Method implementation
   ```

3. **Keep classes focused** on a single responsibility

4. **Use properties** instead of getter and setter methods when appropriate:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self._name = name
           self._age = age
       
       @property
       def name(self):
           return self._name
       
       @name.setter
       def name(self, value):
           if not isinstance(value, str):
               raise TypeError("Name must be a string")
           self._name = value
       
       @property
       def age(self):
           return self._age
       
       @age.setter
       def age(self, value):
           if not isinstance(value, int):
               raise TypeError("Age must be an integer")
           if value < 0:
               raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
           self._age = value
   ```

5. **Use inheritance judiciously** - prefer composition over inheritance when appropriate

6. **Implement special methods** to make your objects behave like built-in types when it makes sense

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming in Python provides a powerful way to structure your code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. By understanding and applying these concepts, you'll be able to design more effective and elegant solutions to programming problems.

Remember that good OOP design comes with practice. Start with simple classes and gradually incorporate more advanced concepts as you become comfortable with the basics.
